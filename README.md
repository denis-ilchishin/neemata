Lightweight Node.js RPC application server

[Example](https://github.com/denis-ilchishin/neemata-starter)

### Features:

- Dependency injection
- [Application server mode](https://github.com/denis-ilchishin/neemata/pull/41) to run multiple instances of application with worker_threads under one process
- Task workers over worker_threads to parallelize CPU-intensive workloads from API workers
- CLI support
- Typescript modules support without build process (runtime transpilation with [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc))
- Hot-reload without server restart (preserving all current connections)

#### First-party adapters and clients:

- **[Î¼WebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js)** with both websockets and http transports support, as well as binary data streaming over websockets
